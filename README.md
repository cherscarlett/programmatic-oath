# The Programmatic Oath
### Primum non nocere; ædifice non nocere

I swear that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.

I will use code to help and enable users according to my ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury and wrong-doing. Neither will I code a bias or weapons into software when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course. I will keep pure and just both my life and my art. I will seek diverse testing and algorithmic feedback to identify prejudice and discrimination so that my work may not result in the oppression of any person or persons based on their race, religion, sexuality, gender, or disability. I will revoke access to any code I’ve written that is used to do harm or for wrong-doing, either by removal, licensing changes, or other means of revoking.

Now if I carry out this oath, and break it not, may I gain for ever reputation among all people for my life and for my art; but if I break it and forswear myself, may the opposite befall me.
